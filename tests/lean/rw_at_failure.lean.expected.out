rw_at_failure.lean:6:10: error: invalid 'rewrite' tactic, no occurrence was replaced, this error may occur when the 'at' modifier is used (e.g., 'at {2}'). Lean uses the following semantics: first it finds a matching subterm; then uses the bound arguments to look for further syntactically identical occurrences; and then it replaces the occurrences specified by the 'at' modifier (when provided)
